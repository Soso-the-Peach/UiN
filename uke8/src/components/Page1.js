            <p>
              Monkey. D. Luffy refuses to let anyone or anything stand in the
              way of his quest to become the king of all pirates. With a course
              charted for the treacherous waters of the Grand Line and beyond,
              this is one captain who'll never give up until he's claimed the
              greatest treasure on Earth: the Legendary One Piece!

                <p>
                  Monkey D. Luffy, also known as " Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly
                  as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and
                  anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the
                  increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well
                  as one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream is to become
                  the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind
                  by the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being the Pirate
                  King means having the most freedom in the world.

                  Village, Zoro is among the three most powerful combatants of
                  the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji. His dream is to
                  become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor
                  a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.

                  She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially
                  joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob them in order to
                  buy back her village from Arlong. However, she legitimately
                  joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated
                  Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.

                  "God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the
                  fourth member of the crew and the third to join, doing so at
                  the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he left the crew
                  during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined at the end of the

                  Usopp is the son of Yasopp and Banchina. He was born and
                  raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp
                  Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After working with the
                  Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was
                  invited to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp
                  dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his
                  father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this
                  dream.

                  Straw Hat Pirates. He is the fifth member of the crew and the
                  fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family
                  (thus making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he
                  disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after
                  reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes
                  as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous
                  chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey
                  D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.

                <p>
                  His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue,
                  which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South
                  Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top
                  three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro.

                <h3>Tony Tony Chopper</h3>
                <p>
                  Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper,
                  is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the sixth member
                  of the crew and the fifth to join, doing so at the end of the
                  Drum Island Arc. He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy
                  Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly
                  returned to Luffy's crew.

                  Fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or
                  a human at will. He came from Drum Island and was taught how
                  to be a doctor by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk
                  and Kureha. His dream is to one day become a doctor capable of
                  curing any disease and wants to travel all across the world
                  specifically in the hopes of accomplishing this dream.

                <p>
                  Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" and the

                  Hat Pirates. She is the seventh member of the crew and the
                  sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She

                  Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the
                  power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any
                  surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West
                  Blue island Ohara, she is currently the only person in the
                  world known to have the ability to read and decipher
                  Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and
                  threatening to the World Government.

                  She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All
                  Sunday", serving and partnering herself directly with the
                  organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who
                  operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary
                  antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw
                  Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the
                  true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.{' '}
